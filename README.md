Cultus Skills Center — Logistic Regression from scratch
=====================================================

What is included
----------------
- main.py: runnable script implementing Logistic Regression from scratch using NumPy.
- report.txt: detailed report describing dataset, implementation, hyperparameter tuning, results, and interpretation.
- metrics.json: JSON file with best hyperparameters and evaluation metrics for validation and test sets.
- model.npy: saved model weights (w plus bias).
- results.txt: same summary as metrics.json.

How to run
----------
1. Make sure you have Python 3 and NumPy installed.
2. Run: python main.py
3. Files metrics.json, report.txt and model.npy will be created in the same directory.

Project requirements satisfied
------------------------------
- Synthetic dataset with 5 features and 500 samples.
- NumPy implementation of logistic regression: sigmoid, loss, gradients, gradient descent.
- Training, hyperparameter search, evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1.
- Single-file deliverables and a single ZIP bundle for submission.
